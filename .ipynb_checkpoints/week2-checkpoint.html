            Nauti-charge Project  update: 

Authors : Patrick Ridley & Shrey Shah

What did you do last week? We were able to get the environment setup. We were able to setup the xcode to work and connect to git account. Decide if we would use the CU boulder git or better to register the org on git. We decided to go with Registration on Git since our project deals with real world work. 

What do you plan to do this week? For the first sprint, Pat plans to start with exploring Native react and Expo and i plan to explore the Swift UI. 

Are there any impediments in your way? We have multiple issues with current setup on xcode and integrating it with a shared git repo. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? Reflecting on the current work done, we think we could have evaluated our hardware requirements earlier and plan accordingly.
