    <h1>Weekly Update</h1>

        <h2>This Week:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Finalizing the company name — surprisingly, this has been the hardest part of setting up the LLC.</li>
            <li>Acquiring a domain name and setting up a professional email.</li>
            <li>Migrating and adjusting the company webpage, then deploying it.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Challenges & Impediments:</h2>
        <p>Choosing a company name has been more difficult than expected. It feels like every dictionary word is already taken and followed by “tech,” “solutions,” or “consulting.” On top of that, verifying that a name doesn’t have unintended meanings in other languages has ruled out a few options. We’re narrowing it down and hope to finalize one soon.</p>
        <p>We resolved the issue with the iPhone Pro. The problem stemmed from using an outdated framework, which we had pulled from an older online tutorial. After switching to NavigationStack, the application behaved consistently between the simulator and the actual iPhone. This highlights the risks of relying on outdated free tutorials.</p>

        <h2>Reflections:</h2>
        <p>I’m now more cautious with online tutorials. I cross-reference each one with up-to-date resources to ensure compatibility with current frameworks. A useful tip: check which iPhone model is being used in the demo. If it’s more than a few years old, the logic may still be valid, but the code is likely outdated.</p>
