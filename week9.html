        <h1>Weekly Progress Report</h1>

        <h2>Last Week</h2>
        <p>
            I worked on the project proposal and took some time to assess my progress. 
            I realized that I have covered a lot of ground on the programming side, with a focus on finding the best 
            way to gather data from the battery without draining the phone battery. I decided to implement a scheduled 
            polling system, setting it to run every 15 minutes. However, if the app is opened, it will poll immediately 
            on startup, similar to accessing the dashboard view.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>
            I find myself held up due to a lack of UI guidance. I’m getting a better sense of what Windfall does not want,
            but I still need more clarity on what they do want. I pushed a TestFlight deployment for them to review and am
            currently waiting for more feedback.  I did point out where it is buggy, and ask them not to focus on that.
        </p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
            I hope to receive logos to incorporate into the project, especially so Shrey can work more on the frontend. Along
            that path, I going to show them Figma (tool I used in a different class) to help them guide us on the design.
            I plan to continue tinkering with Bluetooth and scheduling data collection. Additionally, I want to implement
            auto-polling for a quick report when the page is accessed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’d also like to explore adding a nickname for each battery, rather than displaying a truncated UUID. While this
            is not part of the MVP, I want to keep it in mind while coding so it can be implemented later.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection:</h2>
        <p>

            Bluetooth development is proving to be more challenging than I expected. A poll request can fail if it is not
            executed in the correct order or if a process has timed out. I’m currently researching ways to handle these failures in code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now, my data collectors are running frequently enough that I haven’t encountered this issue often, but I know
            it will become more relevant as I refine the system. There’s still a lot to learn, and I will need to continue
            researching and experimenting to improve the reliability of the polling process.
