    <h1>Status Update</h1>

    <h2>Last Week</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We began pushing releases to Windfall Power for testing and evaluation. It was discovered that the iPhone Pro Max screen size scaled differently and did not look good.</li>
        <li>We validated the issue on the simulator, recoded to correct it, but after pushing the fix, the issue still persisted (as of this morning).</li>
        <li>We found a fellow employee with the same phone model, which allowed us to test on actual hardware — valuable for future testing.</li>
        <li>Windfall liked the application and showed it to partners. We’re now planning to pitch a similar product already crafted to better fit their needs.</li>
        <li>We began researching what's needed to start an LLC and other business essentials like a website and email setup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>This Week</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Focused on cleaning up the application scaling issue, which remains a high priority for cross-device usability.</li>
        <li>Took initial steps toward establishing the LLC, including research and planning.</li>
        <li>Started collecting and reviewing new project requirements for future development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges & Impediments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A major concern was the app behaving correctly in the simulator but failing on real devices — raising questions about testing reliability.</li>
        <li>Budget constraints limit our ability to test on multiple physical devices (iPhone & Android).</li>
        <li>Fortunately, we borrowed a device, which helped us continue testing and progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflections & Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After discussions with Windfall, we recognize the benefit of incorporating a formal design phase into our process.</li>
        <li>Tools like Figma — or even low-fi options like sketches — could help clarify layouts early in development.</li>
        <li>We've struggled with:
            <ul>
                <li>Differences between light and dark modes</li>
                <li>Vertical vs. horizontal layout adjustments</li>
                <li>Frequent changes to logos and graphics</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Establishing a unified design standard would streamline development and reduce UI rework.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Finalize the scaling fix and validate changes on physical devices.</li>
        <li>Continue progressing with LLC formation tasks.</li>
    </ul>
