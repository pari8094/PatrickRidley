        <h2>Week 3 Updates</h2>
        <p>
            Nauti-charge Project  update: 

Authors : Patrick Ridley

This week we have created a git repo, created an apple development account, and started to play with different software suites, such as react native and xcode.  We are planning to go with xcode (Swift) because it has the most complete bluetooth library along with some hardware limits we have (Company computers come preloaded with xcode and we cannot install more programs).  Not the best reason to pick an environment, but not uncommon in the corporate world.  We have started playing around with the simulators and watching videos on how to use it.  We have created a rough outline on how the UI will layout, work still needs to be done the pairing flow and log in point.  I requested a second battery from the Windfall Power to allow both Shrey and I to do bluetooth integration, plus post MVP, there is a need to allow more than 1 battery in the system.

The plans i have for this week, is to continue to learn about Swift and what it can do, plus reviewing the engineering documentation on the BMS and how to interface too it.  Also, look into the first stages of how the behind the scene flow will work with bluetooth.  

I have attached the PDF i plan to review with my contact at Windfall Power once he returns from Europe next week.  Note the boxes in green are the MVP, rest are later phases.  It is simple, but want to be sure he agrees with the process.
