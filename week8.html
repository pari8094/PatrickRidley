        <h1>Weekly Progress Report</h1>

        <h2>Last Week</h2>
        <p>
            I did a lot of cleanup on my Bluetooth scripting and began integrating a parsing utility.  
            I can now collect Report 03 and extract MVP-related data, storing it in the database.  
            This allows me to create a time series dataset that Shrey can use to generate graphs.  
            Currently, I am adding values at 5-second intervals to generate data sets.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>
            One of the biggest challenges was storing data and correctly passing it between functions while maintaining the correct variable type.  
            It took some effort, but I aligned each type properly to prevent build failures.  
            Xcode has some great tools for catching these issues, but I still had to do additional research to resolve them effectively.
        </p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
            I need to streamline how I collect data. There are many suggested methods online,  
            but currently, I am polling the battery too aggressively, which consumes a lot of power.  
            My next step is to find a more efficient method to reduce power consumption while still gathering the necessary data.
