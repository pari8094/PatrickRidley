        <h2>Week 4 Updates</h2>
        <p><strong>Nauti-charge Project Update:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Ridley</p>
        
        <h3>What did i do last week?</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>I created my first webpage (https://pari8094.github.io/PatrickRidley/) and updated Linkedin.  Also, started to
            
            brainstorm about the way bluetooth should work for the Nautic Charge app, then see if it is supported in swift/ios.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>What do i plan to do this week?</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>I plan to push the application from simulator to physical iPhone, directly connected to MAC.  I hope to have a
            framework, something i can show to NauticCharge to help them guide me on how the app should look, and set
            expectations of the limitation of BLE bluetooth.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>No major issues to report.  This week was more about myself (webpage, linkedin vs building the application.  I
        requested another battery for Shrey to code against.  It seems the frontend side requires data which only the
        battery can provide (or i can create a BMS simulator, but that way out of scope).</p>
    </ul>
        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>I really like how i created the l lucid chart.  Besides that, i want to start pushing to get the app from simulator to
            physical device. </p>
