        <h2>Week 6 Updates</h2>
        <p><strong>Nauti-charge Project Update:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Ridley</p>
        
        <h3>Last week:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>I learned a lot about bluetooth and ios.  I followed some tutorials and lots of research and was able to connect to the battery.
                I can validate this by reviewing the log files on xcode.  I requested an additional batteries from Windfall so Shrey can have one 
                to work with.  They are expected to arrive this Friday.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>This week:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>I plan to keep working on the bluetooth functional.  I will keep focusing in the logger and see if i can pull any reports.
                Currently, the battery  forgots when exiting the screen, but will work on that at a later date.  From a studying point of
                view, I plan to start reviewing report 03 info in the engineering documentation</p>
            <p>
                Challenges i had, was figuring out the rules of BLE and iOS.  It has to have a Info file configured such that it provides
                privacy data to the end user.  Plus, it requires it to be configured within the app, vs directly editing it.  I reviewed
                online documentation to overcome this.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>I found myself trying to push ahead faster than i research the method on how to access bluetooth.  I found myself recoding
                a lot of times, but in a odd way, it helps me learn a bit, but i know it slows the progress overall.</p>
        </ul>
