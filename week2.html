        <h2>Week 2 Updates</h2>
        <p><strong>Nauti-charge Project Update:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Ridley & Shrey Shah</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>What did you do last week?</strong><br>
                We were able to get the environment set up. We were able to set up Xcode to work and connect to a Git account. We decided whether to use the CU Boulder Git or register the organization on Git. We chose Registration on Git since our project deals with real-world work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong><br>
                For the first sprint, Pat plans to start by exploring React Native and Expo, and I plan to explore Swift UI.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong><br>
                We have multiple issues with the current setup on Xcode and integrating it with a shared Git repo.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</strong><br>
                Reflecting on the current work done, we think we could have evaluated our hardware requirements earlier and planned accordingly.
            </li>
