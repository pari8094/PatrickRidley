            I focused on adjusting the polling of the batteries to optimize data collection.
            I also began investigating ways to improve data parsing to enhance the diagnostic page.
            Currently, I have the MVP requirements, but adding more features seems straightforward.

            This week is spring break (i view start of week as Thursday)—code for having more time to focus on this instead
            of other classes. My goal is to finalize the MVP requirements, including graphics. We’ve been requesting them for
            a while, but we need to close it out and move on to coding.
