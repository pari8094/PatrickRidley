        <h2>Week 5 Updates</h2>
        <p><strong>Nauti-charge Project Update:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Ridley</p>
        
        <h3>Last week:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>This week as been an eventful week.  This is the first time I was able to push the application to the phone.
                Shrey worked on the basic framework on how the application will run.  I reached out to Windfall for guidance
                on how to lay it out, they gave use liberty in the design if it followed the nature of their web.  With that,
                we took images from there site to create, along with some of my vacation photos.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>This week:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>This week I plan work to see if I can integrate basic Bluetooth function on the phone, scanning, discovery etc.
                This is one of the areas of risk, for it is a new skill I will have to learn to use.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Areas of Education:</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>I plan to research on how the iOS libraries work with BLE devices.  Also, review the engineering document provided
            by the vendor.</p>
    </ul>
        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>I have learned a lot from the first round of design requirements with Windfall.  Part of it, it is perceived it
                will just work, take a couple of weeks and should be ready to go.  They are very busy with their day-to-day 
                projects and provide little guidance on how to layout the page.  I think in the future, I will press more on 
                what they want, vs what I think they will want.</p>
